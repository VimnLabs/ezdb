description: Let's use this awesome database

import { FileTree, Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The use is so simple that you just have to start the class and use a function to start using the database.
```ts copy wrap twoslash showLineNumbers {"Optional":4-5}
import { Database } from "@vimn/ezdb"

const AUTH_KEY = process.env.DATABASE_AUTH as string
// ---cut---
const database = new Database({
	root: './database/', // Folder to create the json files that are the tables.
	tables: ['main'], // Tables to be used

	auth: AUTH_KEY // Authentication code, I recommend that it be placed in a `.env` file.
});

database.begin() // Creates all necessary files and folders
```

<Aside type="tip">
The folder to use in the database is made on the root folder of your project, this means that if you have your main file, for example in `C:/Users/USER/Desktop/.../my_project/src/...`, your project root directory will be the one, in which your executed file is located.
</Aside>

Following the above example, your files should look something like this:
<FileTree>

- package.json
- src
  - database
    - main.json
    - ...

</FileTree>
