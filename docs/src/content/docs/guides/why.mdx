  <TabItem label="Database">
  <Steps>
1. Built on local file storage to ensure optimal performance and straightforward data persistence.

2. Essential functions for data manipulation, including `set`, `get`, and `delete`.

3. High-performance numerical functions—`sum`, `sub`, `multi`, `divide`, `pow`, and `sqrt`—for precise and efficient mathematical operations.

4. Dynamic array manipulation functions such as `push`, `remove`, `unshift`, `shift`, and `pop`.

5. Additional utility functions designed for ease of use:  
   - `ping` to measure latency,  
   - `all` to retrieve the complete database,  
   - `flat` to generate a table with flattened keys,  
   - `sanitize` to safely access keys that contain dots in their names.

  <TabItem label="Backuper">
  <Steps>
1. Supports backing up an entire folder or a single file for flexible data protection.

2. Allows customizable automatic backup frequency in milliseconds to ensure timely backups.

3. Lets you choose the storage location for backups, granting full control over where data is stored.

4. Provides configurable automatic console notifications, enabling you to select which events are reported.

5. Maintains a record in the format `{"id": "absolute path"}`, where the ID is a string representing the timestamp in milliseconds, ensuring precise traceability.

6. Offers complete backup information—including the record ID, the timestamp (using `Date`), the backup entries, and the absolute path—so you have full insight into each backup.

7. Enables seamless restoration by "consuming" a backup, replacing the entire current data set with the backed-up version.
